Practice Statement - Report Generation
Educational institutions are overburdened with paperwork and manual processes. They also find it difficult to maintain records of the studentsâ€™ results, their attendance, assessments, etc. The management and teachers at the Oak Bridge School have already conducted exams for their high school students and the evaluation of the answer sheets is also complete. The teachers with the help of the technical team have to set up a system that automates the grading system. Teams are formed and each team is assigned a task.
Evaluation and Grading Team:
This team needs to evaluate the results and grades of the students. In order to do this, the below calculations have to be made on the data entered.

Calculate the total marks scored by each student.
Find the class average marks.
Find the average marks obtained by students for each subject and store them.

Report Generation Team:
This team has to find the top scorer in the exam and also the students who have failed and passed the exam -

Find the top scorer of the class and display the name of the student.
Find the students who have cleared the examination.
Find the students who have failed in a subject and have to reappear for that exam.

Survey and Statistics Team:
The school conducts a statistical survey to determine the pass percentage and performance of the students. This team builds the necessary statistics for the same.

It generates grades obtained by each student
Displays the roll numbers of the students on the class board in ascending order of the total marks scored in the exam.


Tasks  :

1.Model the classes in Java.
2.Model the attributes for each class.
3.Model the behaviour for each class.
4.Create constructors for each class.
5.In an implementation class create objects for the classes.
6.Initialize constructors with parameters to set values for the attributes of the classes.


Tasks  :
-7.Create objects and call the methods of the class in the implementation session
-8.Display the following.
- Total marks of each student in grade 9.
- The grades of each student in grade 9.
- The name of the students who have cleared the exam.
- The names of students who need to reappear for the exam.
- Student details in sorted order of total marks.(in ascending order -  use any one of the sorting algorithms).
- The top scorer of grade 9(use linear or binary search).

Problem Statement: Automating the National Football League for player registration and team allotment of new matches
National Football League(NFL) is a registered association to host football league competitions.
NFL organized the first league in Spain in 2015.The main aim of NFL is to:

Promote football as a sport worldwide
Turn amateur footballers into professional players

Initially NFL started with a league with four teams.The high-level process was:
1. NFL advertises asking for registration from interested players
2. Players visit the NFL office for registration, fitness test and other formalities
3. NFL based on player’s profile allocates them to form the teams
   NFL wants to automate its team formation process.
   The problem to solve for NFL is to automate the process of player registration and team
   formation.
   Proposed Solution
   In the first phase, NFL should be provided a solution where the football players
   can register themselves. Admin can then be able to allot the registered players randomly to
   their respective selected teams based on the league title availability.
   Following are the classes to be implemented to solve this business problem.

Complete the following model classes as per the requirement.
class Player
Define the following properties.Properties should be private.
-playerId : String
-playerName : String
-password : String
-yearExpr : int
-teamTitle :String
Define parameterized constructor to initialize properties: playerId, playerName, password, yearExpr
Define Getter for all the properties and setter for teamTitle
Override the toString() method to display Player details
Override the compareTo() method to compare players based on playerId
class PlayerTeam
Define the following properties.Properties should be private.
-playerId : String
-teamTitle : String
Define parameterized constructor to initialize all the properties
Define Getter for all the properties
Override the toString() method to display PlayerTeam details
Override the compareTo() method to compare players based on playerId

Complete the following dao classes as per requirement
class PlayerDaoImpl
Define the following methods :
+addPlayer(Player player) : boolean
+findPlayer(String playerId) : Player
+getAllPlayers() : List<Player>
class PlayerTeamDaoImpl
Define the following methods :
+getAllPlayerTeams(String fileName) : Set<PlayerTeam>
